# 💬 Financial Sentiment Analysis

**FinBERT-based sentiment extraction from company filings + extension using semantic similarity**

---

## 📌 Overview
This project replicated and extended FinBERT to classify sentiment in financial text. Added a semi-supervised learning extension using 150K business headlines to improve classification accuracy between neutral and positive classes. Also explored ESG sentence classification from SEC filings.

## 🧠 Techniques & Tools
`FinBERT` · `BERT Fine-Tuning` · `Sentence-Transformers` · `Semantic Similarity` · `Semi-Supervised Learning` · `Pandas` · `PyTorch` · `Scikit-learn`


## 📊 Key Results
- Improved FinBERT precision by +9% with additional pseudo-labeled data
- Reduced misclassification in positive/neutral categories by 12%
- Extension validated FinBERT’s domain advantage vs. BERT base in ESG sentence tagging
